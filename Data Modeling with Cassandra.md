# Data Modeling with Cassandra

Sparkify is a startup with a music streaming app. Data scientists at Sparkify are particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

The goal of this project is to define a data model that will help our data scientists answer questions about user activity. In this case, we are working with a NoSQL database, Apache Cassandra, which means we have to be especially intentional in our data modeling. We first need to understand what queries our data scientists would like to run, and then we can design tables to fit those queries. We will be aiming for "1 query, 1 table".
